My generator supports the following commands:

Pressing the R key regenerates the map using a new seed value, thereby ensuring the map looks different.
Pressing the , or < key causes the noise sample window to shrink, and the . or > key causes the sample window to grow. Pressing any of these keys leads to a new map display, but not a new noise seed value.
My map will have randomized names describing a different part of the map. Used tracery to accomplish this. 

How to run:

1. Download all files and open them in an enviroment of your choosing. (Created using WebStorm in JetBrains Toolbox.)
2. Run all .js files to make sure they work with no errors.
3. Run the index.html file to open the map generator in your browser
  a. Works best in google chrome browser
4. Tinker with the above commands
5. Have fun and enjoy the project!
